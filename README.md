# NHS-Admissions-Dashboard

## Overview 
This project involved the creation of a hospital admissions dashboard in Power BI, designed to track essential metrics such as total admissions, average length of stay, wait times, and patient demographics over a one-year period. The dashboard provides hospital stakeholders with valuable, real-time insights into key trends and performance indicators. By categorizing admissions by type (e.g., Emergency, Planned, Waiting List) and specialty (e.g., Gastroenterology, Pediatrics), the dashboard allows decision-makers to quickly identify patterns, optimize resource allocation, and improve operational efficiency across departments.
